//! Legion aims to be a feature rich high performance ECS library for Rust game projects with minimal boilerplate.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! ## Worlds
//!
//! [Worlds](World) are collections of [entities](Entity), where each entity can have an arbitrary collection of
//! [components](storage::Component) attached.
//!
//! ```
//! use legion::*;
//! let world = World::default();
//! ```
//!
//! Entities can be inserted via either [`World::push`] (for a single entity) or [`World::extend`] (for a collection
//! of entities with the same component types). The world will create a unique ID for each entity upon insertion
//! that you can use to refer to that entity later.
//!
//! ```
//! # use legion::*;
//! # let mut world = World::default();
//! // a component is any type that is 'static, sized, send and sync
//! #[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
//! struct Position {
//!     x: f32,
//!     y: f32,
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
//! struct Velocity {
//!     dx: f32,
//!     dy: f32,
//! }
//!
//! // push a component tuple into the world to create an entity
//! let entity: Entity = world.push((Position { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }, Velocity { dx: 0.0, dy: 0.0 }));
//!
//! // or extend via an IntoIterator of tuples to add many at once (this is faster)
//! let entities: &[Entity] = world.extend(vec![
//!     (Position { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }, Velocity { dx: 0.0, dy: 0.0 }),
//!     (Position { x: 1.0, y: 1.0 }, Velocity { dx: 0.0, dy: 0.0 }),
//!     (Position { x: 2.0, y: 2.0 }, Velocity { dx: 0.0, dy: 0.0 }),
//! ]);
//! ```
//!
//! You can access entities via [entries](world::Entry). Entries allow you to query an entity to find out what
//! types of components are attached to it, to get component references, or to add and remove components.
//!
//! ```
//! # use legion::*;
//! # let mut world = World::default();
//! # let entity = world.push((false,));
//! // entries return `None` if the entity does not exist
//! if let Some(mut entry) = world.entry(entity) {
//!     // access information about the entity's archetype
//!     println!(
//!         "{:?} has {:?}",
//!         entity,
//!         entry.archetype().layout().component_types()
//!     );
//!
//!     // add an extra component
//!     entry.add_component(12f32);
//!
//!     // access the entity's components, returns `None` if the entity does not have the component
//!     assert_eq!(entry.get_component::<f32>().unwrap(), &12f32);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [`world`] module for more information.
//!
//! ## Queries
//!
//! Entries are not the most convenient or performant way to search or bulk-access a world. [Queries](query)
//! allow for high performance and expressive iteration through the entities in a world.
//!
//! ```
//! # use legion::*;
//! # let world = World::default();
//! # #[derive(Debug)]
//! # struct Position;
//! // you define a query be declaring what components you want to find, and how you will access them
//! let mut query = Read::<Position>::query();
//!
//! // you can then iterate through the components found in the world
//! for position in query.iter(&world) {
//!     println!("{:?}", position);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can search for entities which have all of a set of components.
//!
//! ```
//! # use legion::*;
//! # let mut world = World::default();
//! # struct Position { x: f32, y: f32 }
//! # struct Velocity { x: f32, y: f32 }
//! // construct a query from a "view tuple"
//! let mut query = <(&Velocity, &mut Position)>::query();
//!
//! // this time we have &Velocity and &mut Position
//! for (velocity, position) in query.iter_mut(&mut world) {
//!     position.x += velocity.x;
//!     position.y += velocity.y;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can augment a basic query with additional filters. For example, you can choose to exclude
//! entities which also have a certain component, or only include entities for which a certain
//! component has changed since the last time the query ran (this filtering is conservative and coarse-grained)
//!
//! ```
//! # use legion::*;
//! # let mut world = World::default();
//! # struct Position { x: f32, y: f32 }
//! # struct Velocity { dx: f32, dy: f32 }
//! # struct Ignore;
//! // you can use boolean expressions when adding filters
//! let mut query = <(&Velocity, &mut Position)>::query()
//!     .filter(!component::<Ignore>() & maybe_changed::<Position>());
//!
//! for (velocity, position) in query.iter_mut(&mut world) {
//!     position.x += velocity.dx;
//!     position.y += velocity.dy;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! There is much more than can be done with queries. See the [module document](query) for more information.
//!
//! ## Systems
//!
//! You may have noticed that when we wanted to write to a component, we needed to use `iter_mut` to iterate through our query.
//! But perhaps your application wants to be able to process different components on different entities, perhaps even at the same
//! time in parallel? While it is possible to do this manually (see [`World::split`]), this is very difficult to do when the
//! different pieces of the application don't know what components each other need, or might or might not even have conflicting
//! access requirements.
//!
//! Systems and the [`Schedule`] automates this process, and can even schedule work at a more granular level than
//! you can otherwise do manually.
//!
//! A system is a unit of work. Each system is defined as a function which is provided access to queries and shared
//! [`Resources`]. These systems can then be appended to a schedule, which is a linear sequence of systems,
//! ordered by when side effects (such as writes to components) should be observed.
//!
//! The schedule will automatically parallelize the execution of all systems whilst maintaining the apparent order of execution from
//! the perspective of each system.
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "codegen")] {
//! # use legion::*;
//! # struct Position { x: f32, y: f32 }
//! # struct Velocity { dx: f32, dy: f32 }
//! # struct Time { elapsed_seconds: f32 }
//! # let mut world = World::default();
//! # let mut resources = Resources::default();
//! # resources.insert(Time { elapsed_seconds: 0.0 });
//! // a system fn which loops through Position and Velocity components, and reads
//! // the Time shared resource.
//! #[system(for_each)]
//! fn update_positions(pos: &mut Position, vel: &Velocity, #[resource] time: &Time) {
//!     pos.x += vel.dx * time.elapsed_seconds;
//!     pos.y += vel.dy * time.elapsed_seconds;
//! }
//!
//! // construct a schedule (you should do this on init)
//! let mut schedule = Schedule::builder()
//!     .add_system(update_positions_system())
//!     .build();
//!
//! // run our schedule (you should do this each update)
//! schedule.execute(&mut world, &mut resources);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [`systems`] module and the [`system`] proc macro for more information.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! Legion provides a few feature flags:  
//! * `parallel` - Enables parallel iterators and parallel schedule execution via the rayon library. Enabled by default.
//! * `extended-tuple-impls` - Extends the maximum size of view and component tuples from 8 to 24, at the cost of increased compile times. Off by default.
//! * `serialize` - Enables the serde serialization module and associated functionality. Enabled by default.
//! * `crossbeam-events` - Implements the `EventSender` trait for crossbeam `Sender` channels, allowing them to be used for event subscriptions. Enabled by default.
//! * `codegen` - Enables the `#[system]` procedural macro. Enabled by default.
